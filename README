Welcome to rbackup, a script to do backups over rsync.

This script is designed for a scenario in which the local machine is more
trusted than the remote one; typically the local one might be the one with
the tape drive, and/or the one that isn't running the Internet service
that's being backed up and is less likely to get cracked.

This does a "pull" of a directory tree using the rsync(1) tool and creates
version directories so that any particular snapshot (eg. the one before
things went pear-shaped) can be used.  To save disk space, identical files
are hardlinked across version directories.  This makes use of an rsync
behaviour whereby a new file is built and relinked in place of the original
rather than modifying the original in place.

Yes, recent releases of rsync have a --backup-dir option, but it serves
only to put old versions of files in a target directory and doesn't make
it possible to grab a consistent past snapshot of the directory tree (eg.
there's no tracking of when a file first appeared).

To run this, you need to create a backup target directory containing:

  - a subdirectory called "current", which will be the rsync target and
  will contain the most current snapshot.

  - a file called "whence" which typically contains a single line saying
  "server.example.net:stuffdir/" or such, as the "from" argument to rsync.
  This may be preceded by additional rsync options (eg. includes/excludes).

Additional directories will be created, named in the format YYMMDD-HHMM,
containing snapshots at times in the past when rbackup was run.

Rbackup takes a single commandline option, the pathname to the backup
directory.

GNU find(1) and cpio(1) are assumed.

Doing ssh from cron and not having it barf wanting a passphrase is left
as an exercise to the reader.

The rpurge command cleans up old backups, keeping a logarithmic series
of them to (hopefully) provide the optimal mix of fallback dates.

The rreview and rapprove commands allow a "diff -r" to be done between
backup generations to review and approve changes.

This program was initially designed to backup up one of my home machines
(the web/news/mailserver) to the other box with the tapedrive (the
backupserver), but is distributed due to indications it might be more
generally useful.

Thanks to Kai Henningsen, of the .de branch of the Scary Devil Monastery,
for prompting me to put this distribution together.

Special thanks to Andrew Tridgell for doing rsync(1) in the first place.

I'm not including the usual "either version 2 of the License, or (at your

read version 3 before using it, just to be sure it doesn't promise free
phone support or sexual favours from the program's author.
