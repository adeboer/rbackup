rbackup TODO
------------

Generalize install procedure.  Earlier versions assumed an RPM was to be
built, current version does a simple traditional install in
/usr/local/bin.

Rsync should ensure owner rwx in target; some sources have funny perms
and can stop rpurge et al.  Check if this is just u+rwx on directories
and/or only if running non-root.

Should have a lockfile in case another cron instance comes along

Rewrite in C?
