rbackup TODO
------------

Generalize install procedure.  Earlier versions assumed an RPM was to be
built, current version does a simple traditional install in
/usr/local/bin.

Use --link-dest.

STDERR from rsync in realtime.

Rsync should ensure owner rwx in target; some sources have funny perms
and can stop rpurge et al.  Check if this is just u+rwx on directories
and/or only if running non-root.

Minimal filesystem recycling (reduce disk activity)
- rpurge runs first, renames excess dirs to "work.xyz" or such
- select one of those, create new dir only when needed
- rsync --delete --delete-excluded --link-dest=$PWD/current/ $source $PWD/work.xyz/
- rename work.xyz to timestamp if rsync succeeds
- current to be a symlink?  Can rename() for atomic update.

Should have a lockfile in case another cron instance comes along

Rewrite in C?
