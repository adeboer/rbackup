.SH NAME
rpurge - remote backup purge utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
rpurge
.I -v -pNN directorypath
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility purges remote backups done using
.IR rbackup (1).
.PP
A directory pathname may optionally be given on the commandline, in
which case the utility will change to that directory before proceeding.
.PP
This utility scans its working directory for
subdirectories whose names match the form
.IR YYYYMMDD-HHMM* ,
divides them into groups according to the base 2 logarithm of their age
in seconds, and keeps only the oldest in each group.  In other words,
you keep one backup between 2^N and 2^(N+1) seconds old, one between
2^(N+1) and 2^(N+2), and so forth.  Nonmatching files (especially the
.I current
and
.I whence
files) will be ignored.
.PP
If the working directory has a subdirectory named
.IR old ,
then rpurge will descend into it and do its work there.  Note that if this
feature is used, all snapshots must be moved there or they would never be
considered for purging.
.PP
This command understands simple symlinks to snapshots (containing no
slashes and pointing directly at a snapshot 
subdirectory) found in the same directory, and will protect them from
removal.  Example:
.I ln -s YYYYMMDD-HHMM-XYZ keepme
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Output verboseness to STDERR.
.TP
.B -p SECONDS
Sets the number of seconds for which all recent backups are protected.
Default is 7200 (two hours).  This is significant in case
rbackup is still running; if an older empty directory is found it is
assumed that rbackup failed that time and the directory is removed.
.TP
.B -w
Instead of deleting purged snapshots, rename them with a "work."
suffix. This is used by
.IR rbackup (1)
to do snapshotting with minimal filesystem churn.
